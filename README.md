Automated Email Sender Description:

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a script that automates the process of sending emails, providing users with the ability to compose emails, set recipients, and schedule delivery.

Email Composition: Users can compose emails using customizable templates or by typing their own message. The script supports standard email formatting options such as subject line, body text, attachments, etc.

Recipient Management: Users can specify one or multiple recipients for each email, including individual email addresses or groups/lists. The script allows for flexibility in managing recipient lists.

Customization Options: The email sender script offers customization options for email content, including the ability to personalize emails with recipient names, dynamic content insertion, HTML formatting, etc.

Attachment Support: Users can attach files (e.g., documents, images) to emails if needed. The script handles file attachment securely and efficiently.

Delivery Scheduling: Users can schedule emails for delivery at a specific date and time in the future. This feature enables users to plan and automate email campaigns, reminders, or announcements.

Multiple Email Providers: The script supports sending emails through various email service providers or SMTP servers, allowing users to choose their preferred email delivery method.

Authentication: To ensure security, the script implements authentication mechanisms such as OAuth or API keys for accessing the user's email account. This prevents unauthorized access to email sending functionality.

Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle cases such as invalid email addresses, network errors, or failed delivery attempts. Users are provided with informative error messages and prompts for resolution.

Logging and Reporting: The script logs email sending activities, including timestamps, recipient details, and delivery status. Users can review logs and reports to track email delivery performance and troubleshoot issues.
